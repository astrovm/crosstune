# Prep measurements

Measured on 2026-11-03 on a shared 12-core / 31 GB PC with an RX 6800 (gfx1030, 16 GB).
Other agents were building, so these are elapsed times under that load, not isolated throughput.
Raw logs and comparisons stay in `build/syncreplay/bench/`.

| Phase | CPU seconds | GPU seconds | Decision |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Demucs, full LhLmgg_u29k | 124.79 | 18.33 | Use ROCm when explicitly configured, 6.8 times faster |
| Truth, full LhLmgg_u29k | 346.82 | 34.40 | Keep CPU; Vulkan changes the reference |
| Hearing, 24 existing 8-second windows of 5WEjz2YoH80 | 32.2 | 9.3 | Keep CPU; Vulkan changes words and timestamps |
| CPU hearing, full LhLmgg_u29k, 20-second windows | 512.77 | | Keep CPU |
| CPU hearing, full LhLmgg_u29k, 8-second windows | 189.20 | | Keep CPU |

ROCm: existing `~/.cache/crosstune-syncreplay-gpu/bin/python`, torch 2.14.1+rocm7.2.
CPU: existing `~/.cache/crosstune-syncreplay-venv/bin/python`, torch 2.15.0+cu132 with no CUDA device.
`torch.cuda.is_available()` was true in the ROCm environment; GPU activity reached 92% during separation.
No new Python environment or ROCm container was needed.

Full-song CPU and GPU vocal files had identical sample counts (23,108,400), correlation 0.9926209,
and difference SNR 18.3135 dB. Demucs random shifts were unseeded, so this is a signal comparison,
not proof of numerical equivalence. Fresh CPU separation plus transcription also differed from the
saved reference: 20 common lines, median 0.02 s, worst 1.22 s. The saved truth was preserved.

The initial short-window benchmark was stopped when available RAM approached 4 GB, freeing memory
for prep and the other agents. It was measured after RAM recovered. Summing these phase measurements
gives 1173.58 s on CPU versus 1067.12 s with GPU separation (9.1% less). This is a sum of phases
measured under changing load, not a measured end-to-end speedup.

## Vulkan checks

The first build failed on missing `spirv/unified1/spirv.hpp`. Rebuilding with
`-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-I/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/include` succeeded.
An initial CLI invocation rejected the obsolete `-nc` option; the actual comparison used
`-mc 0 -nfa -dtw medium -bs 5 -t 2 -ojf` on the existing CPU-separated vocals.
Token DTW times were passed through the same line matcher and voice-onset adjustment as CPU truth.

| Recording | GPU seconds | Saved / candidate / common lines | Median difference | Worst difference |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 0_RLLNRWur4 | 74.47 | 40 / 40 / 33 | 0.26 s | 0.88 s |
| LhLmgg_u29k | 34.40 | 21 / 23 / 20 | 0.345 s | 1.30 s |
| XB7AmIsxzfI | 109.62 | 15 / 21 / 12 | 0.415 s | 36.31 s |
| ZnrSNEah_20 | 38.91 | 24 / 24 / 23 | 0.33 s | 0.81 s |
| Combined | | 100 / 108 / 88 | 0.30 s | 36.31 s |

Vulkan hearing took 19.6 s with one worker, 9.3 s with three; CPU with six workers took 32.2 s.
Only 15/24 windows had the same words and 6/24 identical words and timestamps. The worst timestamp
change was 2360 ms. GPU hearing and GPU truth were both rejected; their outputs never replaced prep data.

## Interruption and resuming

The previous session records an explicit user request to stop everything at 2026-11-03T23:30:16Z.
There is no evidence that the final prep process crashed. There was a resume bug: `set` skipped a
song once truth existed, even when hearing was incomplete. The regression fails against 06dbca73
because prep is never called, and passes after the fix.

`set --cached` resumes the stored set. Truth is preserved; each heard window is saved atomically;
completion requires both hearing lengths and every expected window. Separation publishes vocals only
once Demucs exits successfully. An individual subprocess failure is named, remaining songs are tried,
and the command exits unsuccessfully with all failed IDs.

Optional ROCm separation:

```sh
DEMUCS_PYTHON="$HOME/.cache/crosstune-syncreplay-gpu/bin/python" DEMUCS_DEVICE=cuda \
  nice -n 10 "$HOME/.cache/crosstune-syncreplay-venv/bin/python" scripts/syncreplay/syncreplay.py set --cached
```

Without those environment variables, separation uses CPU. Truth and hearing always use CPU.

The missing Japanese row had the wrong artist: カシミヤのほほえみ is by 八神純子,
[as credited in the published lyrics](https://www.uta-net.com/song/96712/), not 国分友里恵.

## Limits of the timing table

Truth is an estimated reference, not a human audit of every lyric. Unmatched lines are excluded.
In particular, the existing truth matcher strips non-Latin characters; Japanese and Korean songs
can therefore have very little reference coverage. The overall table prints that coverage explicitly.
Issue #662's target is every line within 0.3 s, none dark. Passing scores on matched lines alone
cannot establish that target for all sung lines. No app timing behavior is changed in this PR.
